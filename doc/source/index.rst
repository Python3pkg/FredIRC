IRC Protocol
++++++++++++

FredIRC tries to implement RFC2812. But as this is no strict standard,
there might be problems with specific IRC Deamons. It was mostly tested with
ircd-hybrid.

Wishlist
++++++++

* Implement more handler methods for messages of the
  `IRC client protocol <http://tools.ietf.org/search/rfc2812>`_
* Allow multiple IRCClient instances and/or to re-run a terminated IRCClient
* Allow multiple server connections
* Utility classes for general bot development
* (X)DCC functionality
* Port to Python 3.0/3.1/3.2 (maybe by using
  `Trollius <http://trollius.readthedocs.org/>`_)
