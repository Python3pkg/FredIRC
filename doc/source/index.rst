Welcome to FredIRC's Homepage!
==============================

FredIRC is an event-driven Python framework for
`IRC (Internet Relay Chat) <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat>`_
bots. It aims to provide a high-level abstraction of
`IRC's internals <http://tools.ietf.org/search/rfc2812>`_, an easy-to-use API
and convinient utilities related to bot development.

FredIRC is developed in `Python <http://www.python.org/>`_ and requires at
least version 3.3. It only depends on
`asyncio <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/asyncio>`_ which is part of the
standard library since Python 3.4 anyway.

.. warning:: While fully usable, FredIRC is still pre-1.0 software and has no backwards
   compatibility guarantees until the 1.0 release occurs. Please make sure to
   read the :doc:`history` carefully anytime you upgrade!

IRC Protocol
++++++++++++

FredIRC tries to implement RFC2812. But as this is no strict standard,
there might be problems with specific IRC Deamons. It was mostly tested with
ircd-hybrid.

Wishlist
++++++++

* Implement more handler methods for messages of the
  `IRC client protocol <http://tools.ietf.org/search/rfc2812>`_
* Allow multiple IRCClient instances and/or to re-run a terminated IRCClient
* Allow multiple server connections
* Utility classes for general bot development
* (X)DCC functionality
* Port to Python 3.0/3.1/3.2 (maybe by using
  `Trollius <http://trollius.readthedocs.org/>`_)
